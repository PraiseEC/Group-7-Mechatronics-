# Voice-Controlled Home Automation System  
**Arduino-based system for controlling appliances and a servo motor using voice commands over serial communication.**  

---

## üìù Description  
This project enables voice-controlled automation of lights, appliances, and a simulated door using an Arduino Uno, relay modules, and a servo motor. Commands are sent via a serial interface (e.g.Bluetooth terminal) to trigger actions like turning devices on/off or opening/closing a door.  

## üöÄ Features  
- Voice command control for 3 relays (appliances/lights) and 1 servo motor (door).  
- Real-time feedback via LED   
- Group commands (`all on`/`all off`) for bulk control.  
- Modular code structure for easy customization.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements  
- Arduino Uno  
- 5V Relay Modules (x3)  
- SG90 Servo Motor  
- Jumper Wires & Breadboard  
- LED (for status feedback)  
- 1kŒ© Resistor (for LED)  
- USB Cable (for Arduino)  
- Device for sending commands (PC/smartphone with serial terminal app)  

## üîß Installation  
1. **Software Setup**  
   - Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).  
   - Install the **Servo library** via `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries`.  

2. **Upload Code**  
   - Clone this repository or copy the provided `.ino` file.  
   - Connect the Arduino to your computer.  
   - Upload the code to the Arduino.  

3. **Hardware Setup**  
   - Wire components as described in the [Wiring Guide](#wiring-guide).  

## üéÆ Usage  
1. Open the **Serial Monitor** (Tools > Serial Monitor, 9600 baud).  
2. Send voice commands (e.g., `lamp`, `fun`, `open door`, `all off`).  
3. Observe LED status and serial feedback for confirmation.  

### Supported Commands  
| Command       | Action                          |  
|---------------|---------------------------------|  
| `lamp`        | Turn Relay 1 (Lamp) ON          |  
| `offline one` | Turn Relay 1 OFF                |  
| `fun`         | Turn Relay 2 (Fan) ON           |  
| `offline 2`   | Turn Relay 2 OFF                |  
| `lights`      | Turn Relay 3 (Lights) ON        |  
| `offline 3`   | Turn Relay 3 OFF                |  
| `all on`      | Turn ALL relays ON              |  
| `all off`     | Turn ALL relays OFF             |  
| `open door`   | Rotate servo to 180¬∞ (open)     |  
| `close door`  | Rotate servo to 0¬∞ (close)      |
